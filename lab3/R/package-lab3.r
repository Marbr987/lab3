#' A package that implements the Euclidean and Dijkstra algorithm
#' 
#' This package includes a function executing the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two input numbers.
#' It furthermore includes a function executing the Dijkstra algorithm. The algorithm provides the distance of the shortest path in an input graph from a starting node that is defined as an input to the function.
